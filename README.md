# Tourist-Helper-App
## Problems Addressed:
* Problems a person faces whenever he/she visits a new city for traveling.
* Problems like public transport, food, language, hotels, etc.

## Overview

Whenever we go to a new location for pending our holidays or even for some work, we always want to get the best services like hotels, public transport, food, etc, at the lowest price.  

In this mobile, we have aimed for providing all the information about the place where a person is or wants to go in the future. It will track your location with the help of google map API and then it will give you the required set of operations.

## Goals:

* As mobile apps are acquiring most of the market nowadays, it provides the easiest method for users to get the best services according to their needs.
* A big database of local information in different cities.

## Scalability:

There is no such mobile app in the market which tells us almost all the local information for tourists. So this app can put a great impact in the market if pitched correctly. 

Also, it would make the journey of a tourist very easy as it will give many services which can reduce their journey costs.

## Tech Stacks Required:

* Java for native android app
* NodeJs and MongoDB for making APIs
* Firebase or SQL for the database.
* GoogleMap APIs

## Limitations:

* If we want more accurate data about different cities, we need more data, and that could be an issue
* If we want to scale up, we need to pay for Google Maps and databases also.

## Roadmap Overview:

* First interval: BrainStorming on all the main features and how it can be implemented int he app
* Second interval: Finalising the designs of the app ( only for the screens we decide in the first interval)
* Third interval: Collecting data through google forms 
* Fourth interval: Making APIs and creating databases
